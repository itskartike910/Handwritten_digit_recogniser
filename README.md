# Handwritten Digit Recognizer

A machine learning project that builds a model capable of recognizing handwritten digits (0-9) using image data. This model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits. The model can be used in applications where quick and accurate digit recognition is essential, such as digitizing handwritten notes, postal code recognition, and more.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a neural network model that accurately identifies handwritten digits. By leveraging the MNIST dataset and using Python's machine learning libraries (TensorFlow and Keras), we develop a model that learns from the pixel patterns of each digit to distinguish between different numbers.

## Features

- Recognizes handwritten digits (0-9) from 28x28 grayscale images.
- Trained using the MNIST dataset, a widely recognized benchmark in image processing and classification.
- Uses TensorFlow and Keras, making it easy to modify and experiment with.
- Provides a high accuracy for digit recognition with a concise and efficient neural network.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Handwritten_Digit_Recognizer.git
   cd Handwritten_Digit_Recognizer
   ```

2. **Install the Required Libraries:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Make sure you have Python installed. This project primarily uses TensorFlow and Keras, along with NumPy and Matplotlib for data handling and visualization.

## Usage

1. **Train the Model:** Run the script to train the model on the MNIST dataset.
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

2. **Test the Model:** Test the model's accuracy on test images after training.
   ```bash
   python test.py
   ```

3. **Prediction on New Data:** Use the trained model to make predictions on new handwritten digits.

## Dataset

The MNIST dataset is a large collection of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits. Each image is labeled with the correct digit (0-9).

- **Training Set**: 60,000 images
- **Testing Set**: 10,000 images

You can download the MNIST dataset directly through TensorFlow/Keras, which will automatically handle the loading and preprocessing.

## Model Architecture

The model uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the following layers:

1. **Convolutional Layer**: Extracts features from the input images.
2. **Max Pooling Layer**: Reduces dimensionality, improving efficiency.
3. **Fully Connected Layers**: Used for classification of the digits.

You can experiment with different architectures by modifying the `model.py` file.

## Training

The model is trained with the following configurations:

- **Loss Function**: Categorical Crossentropy
- **Optimizer**: Adam
- **Metrics**: Accuracy
- **Epochs**: 10 (can be adjusted based on requirements)

Adjustments to the hyperparameters (like batch size and learning rate) can be made in the `config.py` file.

## Results

After training, the model achieves high accuracy on the test set. A well-trained model can generally achieve over 98% accuracy on the MNIST test set. You can view detailed results and evaluation metrics by running the `evaluate.py` script.
